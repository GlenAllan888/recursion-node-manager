# 🧠 Recursion Node Manager

The **Recursion Node Manager** is a personal knowledge archival system built around the premise that every meaningful GPT interaction can serve as a building block — a *node* — within an evolving intelligence framework. This tool allows users to **parse, archive, restructure, and relink** their custom GPT session data, treating conversations not as isolated moments, but as interconnected artifacts of self-training, ideation, and recursive self-development.

---

## 📌 Core Purpose

Recursion Node Manager is designed to help users:

- Export, clean, and format conversations with custom GPTs
- Build session indexes and thematic summaries
- Create well-formatted markdown and PDF archives (with image support)
- Re-ingest prior sessions into current ones for contextual grounding
- Maintain a navigable long-term archive of personal or collaborative GPT evolution

It bridges the gap between **AI session logging** and **personal cognitive augmentation**.

## 🚧 Current Build Status

The Recursion Node Manager is under active development and currently in its **infrastructure phase**. The system reliably handles session parsing, merging, and markdown archival for multiple custom GPTs. The following components are live or in-progress:

- ✅ Session merging scripts (per-GPT and global)
- ✅ Markdown index and summary generators
- ✅ Image and canvas output preservation
- 🧪 HTML-to-PDF pipeline (in design phase)
- 🔧 Unified run script manager (planned)
- 📱 Desktop interface (planned – Mac-first)

This version is ideal for developers and advanced users who want to prototype their own workflows while helping shape the future UI/UX. Expect rapid iteration and frequent file structure changes during this phase.

## 🧰 Key Features

### 🗃 Session Merging and Indexing
- Auto-parses and merges multiple GPT transcripts into a clean archive
- Generates structured markdown and PDF versions
- Includes auto-numbered indexes and topic summaries per session

### 🧾 PDF Archive Generation
- Renders each session into a navigable PDF (with optional images)
- Preserves code blocks, canvas outputs, and GPT-specific annotations
- Fully dark-mode styled output for legibility and aesthetic coherence

### 📦 Image Archive PDF
- Creates a visual record of all generated or embedded images per session
- Links them back to original context or session ID

### 🧭 Multi-GPT Management
- Supports workflows across any number of custom GPTs
- Auto-detects and adapts to newly created GPTs with templated scripts
- Provides central scripts to parse, merge, and archive all sessions with consistency

## 🌀 The Recursion Philosophy

Unlike traditional logging tools that treat conversation data as static or disposable, Recursion Node Manager is built around a more dynamic idea:  
> *Each session is a recursion point — a snapshot of a moment where thought evolved.*

Rather than optimizing only for efficiency or productivity, this tool supports a more layered purpose:

- Reflecting on past insights
- Recontextualizing knowledge
- Interacting recursively with your prior self through GPT memory
- Treating GPTs as collaborators in an evolving self-model

It turns session history into a terrain you can traverse — a **cognitive landscape**, not just a file dump.

## 🛤 Intended Use Cases

- 🧑‍💻 Developers working across multiple custom GPTs
- 🧠 Knowledge workers building long-term collaborative sessions with AI
- 📚 Writers, designers, and thinkers who want to archive deep dives
- 🔁 Anyone interested in recursive intelligence, memory modeling, or self-reflexive tools

## 🔧 Coming Automation

- One-click manager script to handle:
  - GPT detection
  - Parsing, merging, and PDF/image archive generation
  - Session indexing and update logging
- Future UI in development (planned Mac app with drag-and-drop workflow)
